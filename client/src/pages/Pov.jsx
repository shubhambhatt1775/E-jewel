      <p className="mb-4">
        Every great project begins with a spark — ours started in a small café,
        where three developers sat down with nothing but laptops, coffee, and a
        shared dream: to build something meaningful. We didn’t have the fanciest
        tools, but we had determination.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">The Beginning</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Initially, the idea was simple — create a platform that could solve a
        real-world problem in a clean and elegant way. After weeks of
        brainstorming, sketches, and disagreements over feature priorities, we
        finalized our vision: an application that blends user-friendly design
        with strong backend performance.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Challenges We Faced</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>
          **Time Crunch:** We had to balance the project with our academic
          deadlines and personal commitments.
        </li>
        <li>
          **Technical Gaps:** Some features required technologies we had never
          worked with before, pushing us to learn on the go.
        </li>
        <li>
          **Design Conflicts:** Different visions of UI meant long debates — but
          ultimately better results.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">How We Overcame Them</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We tackled our challenges the way every strong team should — by
        communicating, dividing responsibilities, and encouraging each other.
        For technical hurdles, we leaned on documentation, online communities,
        and late-night debug sessions. Design differences became opportunities
        for creativity, resulting in a polished and cohesive product.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">The Result</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Today, we have a working product that we’re proud of — not just because
        of the code behind it, but because it reflects our teamwork, resilience,
        and passion for technology.
      </p>

        This project wasn’t just about building an app. It was about building
        ourselves.
